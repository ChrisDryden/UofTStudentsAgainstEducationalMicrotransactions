# UofTStudentsAgainstEducationalMicrotransactions
A compiled list of classes that have paid components of the curriculum that are required for a graded portion of the class.
Ideally the list will be in a similar fashion to the crowdsourced [toronto-tech-scene](https://github.com/toriagibbs/toronto-tech-scene)

If you do not know how to submit a pull request, you can submit a class to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/UHPLS4AiTN5967i82). All of the responses will be catalogued in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-cekdm6TQVJycQI1bHXJs3eHSkFGf8lgeRyPn0NUM_k/edit?usp=sharing).
